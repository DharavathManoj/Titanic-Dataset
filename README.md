🧠 Task 5 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) | Data Analyst Internship

 📌 Objective
The goal of this task was to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis** on the Titanic dataset to extract meaningful insights using statistical summaries and visualizations.


 📁 Dataset
 File Used: `Titanic Data set.csv`

The dataset contains passenger details like age, sex, class, fare, and survival status. It was used to analyze patterns and relationships influencing survival probability.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

📊 EDA Techniques Used
- `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.isnull().sum()`
- Value counts & distribution plots
- Pairplot, heatmap, boxplots, bar plots
- Correlation analysis

 📈 Key Visualizations
- Histogram of age distribution
- Bar plots showing survival rate by sex and class
- Boxplots showing age distribution across passenger classes
- Heatmap showing correlation between numerical features
- Pairplot to understand multivariate relationships

🔍 Observations
- Females had higher survival rates than males.
- Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive.
- Younger passengers and children had relatively better chances of survival.
- Fare and passenger class showed moderate correlation with survival.

 ✅ Outcome
Gained hands-on experience in:
- Cleaning and analyzing real-world data
- Drawing conclusions using plots
- Presenting insights clearly
